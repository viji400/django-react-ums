Full-stack User Management System using Django and React.

## 🤖 AI Tool Usage

This project was developed rapidly by leveraging an AI-powered assistant, **Google's Gemini**.

It was used to accelerate development in several key areas:

	Generating the initial project structure for both Django (backend) and React (frontend) applications.

	Writing boilerplate code for the Django User model, admin interface, and views.

	Implementing the XML parsing logic within a Django management command to import user data.

	Creating the UserSerializer and REST API endpoints using Django Rest Framework.

	Scaffolding the React UserList component with axios for API integration and useEffect hooks for data fetching.

	Providing the CSS styling for a clean, responsive, and modern UI layout.

Finally, the complete project was version-controlled and pushed to GitHub with meaningful commits.
